        <h1>Why Do Cats Nap So Much?</h1>
        <p>
          Cats spend a huge portion of their lives snoozing in sunlit spots.
          It's not because they're lazy, but because this behavior is rooted in
          their biology. Tiny predators save energy for the occasional midnight
          adventure.

        <h2>The Secret Life of Garden Gnomes</h2>
        <p>
          If you want to understand garden gnomes, you must watch them closely
          when no one is looking. They migrate under the cover of darkness,
          reshaping landscapes and plotting their next mischievous escapade.
